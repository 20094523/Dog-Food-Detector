# Dog Food Detector
#### Student Name: *Dominik Martynski*   Student ID: *20094523*

A device attached to a dog bowl which alerts the user whenever it is empty and in need of refilling. 

## Tools, Technologies and Equipment

I think a light sensor of some kind will be used. Tools to modify the dog bowl. A raspberry pi connected to the internet. An arduino board with the appropriate cables. A phone to receive the alert. Either python or java code.
